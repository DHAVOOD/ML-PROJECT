CAPSTONE PROJECT - EMPLOYEE ATTRITION PREDICTION

The HR employee attrition dataset is a popular dataset created by IBM that contains information about employees of a fictional company, including their job roles, education level, job satisfaction, performance ratings, and whether or not they have left the company (i.e., experienced attrition). The dataset can be used to explore factors that may contribute to employee attrition and to build predictive models to identify employees who are at risk of leaving the company.

The dataset contains 35 columns and 1,470 rows, and is available for download on several data science websites, such as Kaggle and the IBM Watson Analytics Community. The columns include information on employee demographics (age, gender, marital status), job characteristics (department, job role, hourly rate, years at company), performance evaluations (job satisfaction, performance rating), and attrition status.
